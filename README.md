# Flutter State Management Challenge

One year challenge app using Provider state management package

## Introduction

Recently I read a Flutter State Management article on Medium: [Flutter #OneYearChallenge; Scoped Model vs BloC Pattern vs States Rebuilder](https://medium.com/flutter-community/flutter-oneyearchallenge-scoped-model-vs-bloc-pattern-vs-states-rebuilder-23ba11813a4f)

This article discussed various different state management techniques and consisted of a challenge that the author of the article solved using the States_rebuilder state management package that the author has developed.

The current recommended Flutter state management solution from the Flutter team is the [Provider package](https://pub.dev/packages/provider). This repository is my attempt to solve the challenge presented in the article with Provider package to see if it can handle the challenge put forth by the author.
